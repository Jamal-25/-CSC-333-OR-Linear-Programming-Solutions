Hereâ€™s a sample README.md file tailored for the CSC 333 Lab Assignment 1:

CSC 333: Computational Science and Numerical Methods

Lab Assignment 1 - Linear Programming Solutions

Project Overview

This repository contains solutions for Lab Assignment 1 of the CSC 333 course, focusing on solving linear programming (LP) problems. The solutions are provided in two formats:

	1.	Hand-drawn graphical solutions for each LP problem.
	2.	Python graphical solutions, using Python libraries such as matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy.

The objective is to solve LP problems graphically, identify feasible regions, and calculate optimal solutions.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

ðŸ“¦ CSC-333-OR-Linear-Programming-Solutions

Files

	1.	hand_solutions/: Contains scanned images or PDFs of hand-drawn graphs for each problem.
	2.	python_solutions/: Includes Python scripts for solving LP problems graphically.
	3.	requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries required to run the solutions.
	4.	README.md: Documentation about the project and usage instructions.

Linear Programming Problems

The following LP problems are solved:

	1.	Maximizing Profit for a Factory
	2.	Minimizing Cost for a Manufacturer
	3.	Maximizing Production with Multiple Resources
	4.	Maximizing Revenue from Sales
	5.	Resource Allocation for Two Projects
	6.	Production Planning for a Bakery
	7.	Minimizing Cost for a Transport Company
	8.	Maximizing Revenue from Two Products
	9.	Advertising Campaign Budget Allocation
	10.	Meal Planning for a School Cafeteria

Python Implementation

The Python solution uses:

	â€¢	matplotlib: For plotting constraints and feasible regions.
	â€¢	NumPy: For handling arrays and performing calculations.
	â€¢	SciPy or PuLP: For solving linear programming problems programmatically.

Features of Python Solutions

	â€¢	Plots constraints and feasible regions.
	â€¢	Identifies corner points of feasible regions.
	â€¢	Calculates optimal solutions for objective functions.

How to Run the Python Code

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed along with the following libraries:

	â€¢	matplotlib
	â€¢	numpy
	â€¢	scipy

Install them using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Code

	1.	Open the Python file in an IDE like PyCharm or run it via Jupyter Notebook.
	2.	Execute the script:

python lp_graphical_solution.py


	3.	View the graphical output with constraints, feasible regions, and optimal solutions.

Submission Instructions

	1.	Ensure your repository is public or accessible to the reviewer.
	2.	Include all files (hand-drawn solutions, Python scripts, and README).
	3.	Submit the repository link via this form.
